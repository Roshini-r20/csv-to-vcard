# CSV to vCard Converter

This Python script allows you to convert contact information from a `.csv` file into a `.vcf` (vCard) file.
vCards are widely used for importing contacts into mobile phones and email clients.

## üìÅ Features

- Converts each row in a CSV to an individual vCard entry.
- Supports UTF-8 encoding for international character support.
- Outputs a `.vcf` file compatible with phones, email clients, and contact apps.

## üìã CSV Format

Ensure your CSV file (`contacts.csv`) has the following header structure:

```csv
Name,Number
John Doe,+1234567890
Jane Smith,+1987654321
````

> Each row should contain the contact's name and phone number.
